   <p>language that goes beyond the dictionary meaning of the word or phrase</p>
   					
   <p>Non-literal language uses words or expressions with a meaning that is different from
      the literal interpretation. Figurative language includes, but is not limited to: metaphor,
      sarcasm, simile, personification, hyperbole, symbolism, idioms, and clich√©. For example:
   </p>
   					
   <ul>
      						
      <li>"I've told you a million times to clean your room!"</li>
      						
      <li>"The sun is like a yellow ball of fire in the sky."</li>
      						
      <li>"You are what you eat."</li>
      						
      <li>"Busy as a bee."</li>
      					
   </ul>
   					
   <p class="ednote">This definition was included in support of <a href="#dfn-concrete-wording">concrete wording</a>, but the term there is "literal language", the opposite of this definition, so link
      to here not added.
