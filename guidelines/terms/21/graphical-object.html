      with semantic meaning
   </p>
   					
   <p>A graphical object may be a component of a larger structured graphic such as a chart
      or map. There is a related concept in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/graphics-aria-1.0/#graphics-object">WAI-ARIA graphics module graphic-object role</a> [[!graphics-aria-1.0]] for graphics with a document structure but this applies to
      bitmap and vector graphics, or distinct visual elements within them.
