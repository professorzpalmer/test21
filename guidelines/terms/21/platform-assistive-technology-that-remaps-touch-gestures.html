   <p>software that is integrated into the operating system, ships with the product, and/or
      is updated or installed via system updates
   </p>
   					
   <p>This software changes the characteristics of the touch interface when turned on. For
      example, a system screen reader may remap a right swipe gesture to move focus from
      item to item instead of it's default behaviour when the assistive technology is not
      on.
