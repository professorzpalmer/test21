   <p>If the technologies being used have the ability to change the default appearance of text (with the exception of images of text and <a>captions</a>, there is no loss of <a>essential</a> content or functionality when the following are changed:
   <ol>
     <li>text color and background color to a single different text color and a single different background color</li>
     <li>line spacing (leading) to at least 1.5</li>
     <li>letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 em</li>
     <li>word spacing to at least 0.16 em</li>
   </ol>

  <p class="note">Editor's note: The Working Group seeks to include changes in font-family for text as part of the SC, but is not yet able to identify a way to do so that is sufficiently testable.</p>
