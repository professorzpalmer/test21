   <p>Where content can time out, the content must also conform to all of the below:</p>
   					
   <dl>
      						
      <dt>Loss of data</dt>
      						
      <dd>The user can easily return to the same point in a task, without data loss, for a period
         of at least one week as the default, or via a user-settable option available throughout
         the task. If the data will only be preserved for a limited time, the user is informed
         of the length of time that data are preserved at the start of the task.
      </dd>
      						
      <dt>Timing adjustable</dt>
      						
      <dd>The function to turn off, adjust, or extend timing is controlled by a simple action,
         and is labeled with simple, <a>understandable language</a>.
      </dd>
      						
      <dt>Aware</dt>
      						
      <dd>The user is informed of timeout limits at the start of the task, including the length
         of the warning.
