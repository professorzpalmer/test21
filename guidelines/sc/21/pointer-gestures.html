   <p>Functionality requiring complex or timed pointer gestures or multi-pointer gestures
      can also be operated with simple pointer gestures.
   </p>
   					
   <p class="note">Examples of a multi-pointer gesture include two-finger pinch/zoom</p>
   					
   <p class="note">This requirement applies to web content which interprets pointer gestures (i.e. this
      does not apply to gestures that are required to operate the user agent or assistive
      technology)
