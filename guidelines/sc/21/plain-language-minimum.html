   <p>Provide clear and simple language in instructions, labels, navigational elements,
      and error messages which require a response to continue, so that all of the following
      are true:
   </p>
   					
   <dl>
      						
      <dt>Simple tense</dt>
      						
      <dd>Use present tense and active voice.</dd>
      						
      <dt>Simple, clear, and common words</dt>
      						
      <dd>Use the most common 1500 words or phrases or, provide words, phrases or abbreviations
         that are the most-common form to refer to the concept in the <a>identified context</a>.
      </dd>
      						
      <dt>Double negatives</dt>
      						
      <dd>Double negatives are not used.</dd>
      						
      <dt>Concrete language</dt>
      						
      <dd>Non-literal language is not used, or can be automatically replaced, via an easy-to-set
         user setting. All meaning must be retained when non-literal text is replaced.
      </dd>
      						
      <dt>Instructions</dt>
      						
      <dd>Each step in instructions is identified.</dd>
      					
   </dl>
   					
   <p><strong>Exceptions:</strong></p>
   					
   <ul>
      						
      <li>When a passive voice or a tense (other than present tense) is clearer. Other voices
         or tenses may be used when it has been shown to be easier to understand, friendlier,
         or appropriate.
      </li>
      						
      <li>In languages where present tense and active voice do not exist, or are not clearer
         in the language of the content, use the tense and the voice that are clearest for
         the content.
      </li>
      						
      <li>When describing or discussing past or future events, the present tense is not required.</li>
      						
      <li>If the writing style is an essential part of the main function of the site, such as
         a game, a literary work, or teaching new terms.
      </li>
      						
      <li>Where less common words are easier to understand for the audience.</li>
      						
      <li>The content will be penalized for not conforming to a given writing style (such as
         a CV, dissertation, or Ph.D. proposal).
      </li>
      						
      <li>If there are no tools available in the language of the content that identify uncommon
         words, instructions that are longer then 400 words are exempt unless they directly
         relate to a <a>critical service</a>.
      </li>
      					
   </ul>
