		<h1>Understanding Contextual Information</h1>
		<section id="intent">
			<h2>Intent</h2>

			<p>The intent of this success criterion is to support personalization and support user preferences and user needs through the use of metadata consumable by assistive technologies, user agents or other technologies that allow a user to customize the appearance of various controls. By applying this information from a publicy available vocabulary, technologies can respond to the purpose of a control, and present it to the user in a custom, user defined way.</p>

			<section id="benefits">
				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Users with cognitive disabilities.</li>
					<li>Any user who relies on user defined customization technologies.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Postal Address</h3>
						A users address is not always the users address. Sometimes it refers to the address on a credit card, sometimes it refers to their home, sometimes shipping, etc. Easily distinguishing what type of address is needed is essential.
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Navigation Landmarks</h3>
						A user jumping between pages on your website can easily identify various navigation landmarks like home buttons and menu items.

			<h2>Techniques</h2>
			<div class="instructions">
				<p>This section references techniques that can be used to meet the Guideline or Success Criterion. There are sub-sections for sufficient techniques, advisory techniques, and failures. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Within each sub-section, there may be "situations" to describe when a set of techniques need to be considered. Remove the sub-section and heading if situations are not used.</li>
					<li>Techniques are provided in an unordered list. Reference techniques by linking to the filename of the technique and using the technique ID as link text. Use unlinked plain text if the technique has not been written yet.</li>
					<li>If more than one technique must be used for full sufficiency, list them in the same bullet separated by "AND".</li>
					<li>If a general technique requires technology-specific techniques to be implemented, end the bullet with "using" and provide a sub-list of those techniques.</li>
					<li>Square brackets indicate optional components.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Remove any parts of the template that are not used, such as the section and heading for situations, sub-lists of techniques, or the "AND" construction. Also remove the square brackets around placeholder optional components.</p>

				<h2>Failure</h2>
